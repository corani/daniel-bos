										At Indenty we believe that to support rapid innovation employees should have the freedom to carve out their own job description. In the years I have worked with Dani&euml;l Bos, I have seen him grow as a Senior Software Engineer, taking over more and more responsibilities as a Tech Lead. Some of these include the profesionalization of the Research &amp; Development department, getting the entire team onboard to follow an Agile development process, organizing training and certification sessions and helping prove the profitability of the department.</p><p>Dani&euml;l is highly respected by his co-workers for his willingness to help anyone anytime he can. He is a creative thinker, always challenging the organization with new solutions to problems and ideas for new products and services. He is very well organized, diligent, easily reachable, always on time and takes initiatives that go beyond the parameters of his job.

											<blockquote><p>
										This letter is my personal recommendation for Dani&euml;l Bos. I have been Dani&euml;l's immediate supervisor for several years, first at Gladior and later at Indenty. Demonstrating great skill and a strong dedication, he has moved quickly from Medior level Engineer to Senior Engineer at Gladior. When Indenty was founded, I entrusted him with the responsibility of setting up the Research and Development department and the day-to-day management as a Tech Lead.</p><p>In his role as a Tech Lead he has researched various development processes and adapted the Scrum proces to our needs. Besides the development process, he has managed to standardize the programming languages, the build system, the testing procedures and the frameworks that are used, which has resulted in much more confidence in the software that is being developed.</p><p>Dani&euml;l leads by example and many people here find his enthusiasm and dedication both inspiring and motivating. He has managed to create strong cohesion within his department by encouraging his co-workers to take responsibily for their projects and promoting an environment of sharing information and helping each other out. His efforts have created a happier and more productive team.

								<section class="description"><p>Thanks to my sound background, I was able to complete the four year bachelor program within three years. I studied subjects such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Software architecture, design and algorithms;</li>
	<li>Software processes (such as Waterfall and RUP);</li>
	<li>Object oriented programming (Java and C++);</li>
	<li>Web development (PHP);</li>
	<li>Database design and management;</li>
	<li>Robotics and Embedded systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>As my graduation project I designed and build, with two fellow students, a computer operated telephony switching system, including functionality for dial-plans, voice-mail (retrievable via remote dial-in, via e-mail or via the internet), logging and billing per extension, automatic answering and voice menus, etc.</p></section>

								<section class="description"><p>Technisch College Ede is one of the foremost vocational education institutions in The Netherlands. Here I studied as an electrical engineer, with a focus on Computer Hardware and Embedded Systems. I studied subjects such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Procedural programming (Pascal, C, x86 Assembler);</li>
	<li>Object Oriented programming (Pascal, C++);</li>
	<li>Design of computer hardware;</li>
	<li>Design of analog circuits.</li>
</ul>
<p>As my graduation project I designed and implemented (both hardware and software) an ISA-card to monitor a phone-system for billing purposes, to be used in e.g. hotels.</p></section>

											<blockquote><p>
										<p>During my study on the Technical High School I have spend a lot of time with Daniel Bos. We did our final assesment project together in 2000. Daniel does have a big interest in software programming, but also Hardware engineering is something he can handle very easy.</p><p>Daniel moved to Hengelo to go to Technical university. I always knew he would have a great career. Daniel absolutely needs challenges in his jobs, but when you give him the space to be creative, he can do the impossible.</p>
